#
#   Bankd script is one of those 'wouldn't it be kinda cool if' ideas I came 
#   up with mainly to entertain myself. The idea was to come up with a
#   banking system that could be used for role playing purposes in selected
#   channels allowing users to transfer funds to other users and collect
#   interest.
#
#   The public command allows users to check thier balance or transfer
#   funds to another user (provided both have accounts). Bot owners 
#   have access to the dcc/partyline command '.bankd' which allows them to add,
#   remove, list, check, and edit the 'bank accounts'. An automatic timer 
#   periodically adds an 'interest' to all existing bank accounts.
#
#
#   Initial channel setup:
#   (enables use of public info command in specified channel)
#    .chanset #channel +bankd
#
#   Public command syntax:
#    .bank ?balance|transfer? ?args?
#
#   DCC (partyline) command syntax:
#    .bankd ?add|remove|check|list|edit? ?args?
#
#   Example Usage:
#    (public)
#       <lee8oi> !bank balance
#   <dukelovett> lee8oi, your balance is: 1000
#       <lee8oi> !bank transfer 100 dukelovett
#   <dukelovett> transfer successful.
#       <lee8oi> !bank
#   <dukelovett> usage: .bank ?balance|transfer? ?args?
#
#    (DCC/Partyline)
#       <lee8oi> .bankd add jimmy
#   <dukelovett> account created.
#       <lee8oi> .bankd remove jimmy
#   <dukelovett> account removed.
#       <lee8oi> .bankd
#   <dukelovett> usage: .bankd ?add|remove|check|list|edit? ?args?
#       <lee8oi> .bankd add
#   <dukelovett> usage: .bankd add <name>
